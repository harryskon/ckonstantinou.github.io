<h2>Call for Articles for a <b>Special Issue</b> on <b>Consumer, Commercial, and Industrial IoT Security and Resilience</b></h2>
<p>The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm includes the interconnection of sensing, communication, and computing embedded systems. Such technologies are able to collect and analyze data as well as interact over a network towards more efficient and reliable applications and services in the areas like smart grids, smart cities, healthcare systems, and smart homes, while considering the resource-constraint devices in terms of energy, bandwidth and memory that drive the IoT infrastructure. Due to the large number of heterogeneous IoT systems interacting and working under cyberphysical environments, the IoT ecosystem covers the subset of <b>consumer, commercial, and industrial IoT</b> domains. Although these sectors and technologies of IoT solutions share common technologies (e.g., cloud computing, sensing, analytics), they have certain differences in terms of their service model, criticality level, connectivity, impact, data volume, etc. Among such parameters, <b>security and resilience</b> of consumer, commercial, and industrial IoT solutions are critical considering the needs of the domain they are deployed. Driven by the growing number of cybersecurity threats that threaten IoT technologies including devices, protocols, and their interfaces as well as the requirement of developing IoT solutions able to be operate resiliently in the event of adverse events, the purpose of this special issue is to provide the academic and industrial communities a venue covering all aspects of state-of-the-art approaches, methods, and systems at the crossing of consumer, commercial, and industrial IoT and security/resilience, to advance their joint applications.<br /></p>
<p>Topics of interest for this Special Section include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Artificial Intelligence in IoT security/resilience</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secure, reliable, resilient, and interoperable IoT</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cross-domain trust, privacy, and management methods</p>
</li>
<li><p>IoT in modeling, simulation, assessment platforms, and cyberphysical systems</p>
</li>
<li><p>Economic analysis of IoT security/resilience</p>
</li>
<li><p>Theoretical and innovative security techniques</p>
</li>
<li><p>Intelligent control strategies for attack detection and prevention</p>
</li>
<li><p>Access control and anomaly detection</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secure networking, protocol, and computing architectures</p>
</li>
<li><p>Data analytics and efficient data sharing  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Submission Procedure</b>: All original manuscripts or revisions to the IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine must be submitted electronically through IEEE Manuscript Central, <a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cemag">https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/cemag</a>. Author guidelines and submission information can be found at <a href="https://cesoc.ieee.org/publications/ce-magazine.html">https://cesoc.ieee.org/publications/ce-magazine.html</a>. Make sure you are selecting the appropriate special section during manuscript submission.
